For purposes hereof, Publisher's identifying details will be those provided by it during the registration process for creating its first Application hereunder or as may be updated during the Term (as defined below) subject to Conduit's prior written approval.

The Indemnified Party may join in the defense of such Claim with counsel of its choice at its own expense.</li>

    </li>
    <li><strong>TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>This Agreement shall commence on the date Publisher agrees to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as set forth above and shall continue in force thereafter, unless terminated as provided herein (the "Term").</li>
        <li>Either party may terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days' prior written notice to the other party for any reason and without liability for such termination.</li>
        <li>Conduit may immediately suspend the Publisher Account or terminate this Agreement and disable an Application, in any one of the following instances: (a) if Publisher breaches any obligation, representation and/or warranty contained in this Agreement; (b) if Publisher engages in any acts prohibited by this Agreement; (c) if Publisher engages in any action that, in Conduit’s sole discretion, reflects poorly on Conduit or otherwise disparages or devalues Conduit’s reputation or goodwill; (d) if Publisher becomes insolvent or makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar transfer evidencing insolvency, or suffers or permits the commencement of any form of insolvency, administration or receivership proceeding, or has any petition under bankruptcy, insolvency or administration law filed against it, which petition is not dismissed within thirty (30) days of such filing, or has a trustee, administrator or receiver appointed for a material portion of its business or assets. If Publisher becomes subject to any of the events described in this clause (e) it shall immediately notify Conduit in writing; or (f) if Conduit reasonably determines that it is commercially impractical for Conduit to continue supporting an Application and the Conduit Platform under the terms of this Agreement as a result of legal, business or technical considerations.</li>
        <li>Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights and licenses granted hereunder by each party shall cease immediately, provided, however, that in the event that Publisher Materials remain in an Application, Conduit shall have the right to transmit, display or modify such Publisher Materials for as long as an Application is in use by any End User; (b) Publisher shall promptly return to Conduit, or destroy and certify the destruction of, all of Conduit’s Confidential Information, in accordance with Section 8.2; (c) Publisher’s rights to use the Conduit Platform or any part thereof in connection therewith and an Application, as permitted under this Agreement, shall cease immediately; (d) Publisher shall immediately cease using the download link to any Application; and (e) Conduit shall have the exclusive right to modify an Application or remove any Application from the Conduit Technology and/or disable any Application.

Furthermore, Conduit will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in its data centers related to the Publisher Account or to forward any information to Publisher or any third party.</li>
        <li>Following the termination of this Agreement, any provisions of this Agreement that, in order to fulfill the purposes of such provisions, need to survive the termination of this Agreement (including Articles 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 and Section 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. 5.2, and this Section 12.5), shall be deemed to survive for as long as necessary to fulfill such purposes.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>MISCELLANEOUS.</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any other prior or collateral agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof, whether oral or written.</li>
        <li>Publisher may not assign its rights and/or delegate its obligations under this Agreement without Conduit’s prior written consent. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of each of the parties and their respective successors and assignees. This Agreement is not made for the benefit of any third party who is not a party hereto, and only the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns will acquire or have any benefit, right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.</li>
        <li>This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules and principles, and applicable federal U.S. laws shall govern this Agreement. Each party agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New York State, located in New York, New York and the Federal courts of the Southern District of New York. The parties specifically exclude from application to the Agreement the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.</li>
        <li>Neither party shall be liable hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations on account of strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, earthquakes, Internet outages, acts of God, war, governmental action, or any other cause that is beyond the reasonable control of such party.</li>
        <li>If any provision of this Agreement is held or made invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, and the invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by a mutually acceptable provision, which being valid, legal and enforceable comes closest to the original intentions of the parties hereto and has like economic effect.</li>
        <li>The failure to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect a party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter; nor shall waiver of a breach of any provision constitute a waiver of the provision itself.</li>
        <li>The parties hereto are and shall remain independent contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to create any agency, partnership or joint-venture relationship between the parties. Neither party shall be deemed to be an employee or legal representative of the other, nor shall either party have any right or authority to create any obligation on behalf of the other party.</li>
        <li>All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in English and in writing and shall be delivered (a) to Conduit - by facsimile, e-mail or other electronic means, by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid) or by overnight courier service, at the address set forth in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement or at such other address as Conduit shall have furnished to Publisher in writing. A notice shall be deemed given (i) upon receipt when delivered personally, (ii) upon verification of receipt via facsimile or e-mail, (iii) within one (1) business day of being sent by overnight courier, or (iv) within three (3) business days of being sent by registered or certified mail, and (b) to Publisher - to the e-mail address provided by Publisher in connection with its Publisher Account. For purposes of the foregoing, Conduit shall be permitted to rely upon the e-mail address provided by Publisher to Conduit as provided above and shall not be responsible for delays in the delivery of e-mails which delays are not associated with Conduit’s mail server.</li>
